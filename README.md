# 4 Tier Cedar Planter

As a quarantine project in May 2020, my boyfriend and I built a custom planter for indoor or outdoor use. Comments on the original post from r/gardening requested design details so I've cleaned up our basic design into a SolidWorks assembly so others can recreate/modify the design for their own use. Pictures of the original construction can be found in ```/images```

## Organization

The next section will give vague (but hopefully helpful) instructions on how to go about building the planter. These steps are intended as a guide for where to start and what order to build in. This process is by no means the best, but worked for us in the original construction. 

The following section will provide a directory structure of each part file as well as what component of the planter it belongs to. 

## Specifications
- Height: 40.25"
- Width: 26.56"
- Depth: 26.56"
- Weight: Roughly 10-20 pounds empty and 40-60 filled with soil

## Materials
- Wood: Cedar (four 1x8 8ft and three 1x2 8ft boards), four 2'x2' 1/8" plywood boards
- Fasteners: 1.5" Brass wood screws (cut or ground down as needed), 1.5" pneumatic nails, and 0.25-0.50" staples
- Liners: [Haultail 7 MIL 42 gallon woven polyproplyene contractor bag](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Haultail-Woven-Contractor-Bag-20-Pack-42-Gallon-White-Polypropylene-Construction-Trash-Bag/1000812566)
- Water tray: 11.5" painter tray ([here](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Less-Mess-15-5-in-x-11-5-in-Disposable-Paint-Tray/3371172)
- Sandpaper
- Clear polyurethane (or the stain/varnish of your choice)

## Construction Process

This section will give vague (but hopefully helpful) instructions on how to go about building the planter. These steps are intended as a guide for where to start and what order to build in. This process is by no means the best, but it worked for us in the original construction. Throughout the building process, we often deviated from the plans by (instead of measuring exact lengths) lining pieces up as we saw fit and then marking where to cut other pieces. While the SolidWorks files are representative of the design, I highly recommend that you start with some easy cut (say the 2.5ft x 2.5ft bottom tier floor) and just start lining pieces up to figure out where to cut. 

1. Plane all 1x8 cedar boards down to 0.5". 
2. Cut the floor panels for each tier from the plywood panels. 
3. Form the L-shaped boxes for each tier. Glue the pieces to each other and the floor panel. Then, nail the boards together. This works best if you can glue all pieces simultaneously and then nail them together while the glue is still wet. It works best to have two people holding the boards in place while a third glues/nails.
4. Drill drain holes in each box.
5. Cut the shelf edge pieces from the 1x2 boards and glue/nail to the floor panels.
6. Cut, glue, and nail the baseboard and tray holder pieces to the bottom tier. Add store-bought feet to the corners of the baseboard panels, if desired.
7. Cut the rails using the 1x2 boards. The easiest way to do this is to ignore the design. Hold the rails and position them as you'd like, then have someone mark where the angled cuts should be. 
8. Sand the boxes and rails and varnish with a clear polyurethane (can use a stain instead, if desired). Once the varnish has had time to dry (at least overnight), lightly sand and apply another coat. The number of clear coats is up to you but I'd recommend 2-3 coats.
9. Line the boxes. I recommend cutting the bags along a side and bottom seam so that it folds out into a single-layer rectangle. Then, use two bags and carefully fold the bag into the corners of each L-shaped box. This step is easiest with two people. Once the lining is in place, use a stapler to secure the lining. 
10. Get 1" diameter plastic sink plugs. It doesn't matter what you use here, but you need it to have a threaded pipe with a nut. If using a solid plug, drill a hole through the top to allow water to flow through the pipe. Cut the pipe (if necessary) down to 1-2" long.
11. Use a box cutter to carefully slit the liner in a few directions over each drain hole. Fold the liner down into the drain hole. Fit the sink plug (drain) into the drain hole and fasten the nut so that the liner is secured between it and the box.
12. Align the boxes on top of each other and fasten the diagonal rails to the sides of the boxes. Screw the two rails together at the top (you'll need to either use shorter screws or cut the screw down so it doesn't stick out). Finally, attach the vertical rails to the shelf edges on each box.
13. Slide the water tray into the grooves below the bottom tier.
